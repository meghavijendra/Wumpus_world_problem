# Wumpus_world_problem

Implementation of knowledge base and an inference engine for the wumpus world problem

The program will create a knowledge base (stored as a text file) storing the rules of the wumpus world, i.e., what we know about pits, monsters, breeze, and stench. Second,it will create an inference engine, that given a knowledge base and a statement determines if, based on the knowledge base, the statement is definitely true, definitely false, or of unknown truth value.

To run the program use the following command: <br />
python check_true_false.py Wampus_rules.txt a.txt b.txt<br />

The output will be shown on result.txt file.
